                <h4><u><strong>Circuit Switching Problem</strong></u></h4>
                Designed in 1878, <strong>circuit-switching</strong> was a method of creating a communications network between two
                people. Telephone calls were connected by two network nodes and established a channel. If the connection
                between two telephones is broken, the call is lost.
                This weakness became a national threat to the military when they were afraid of a Soviet Nuclear Attack.
                All the telephone lines were centralized in one location, and if an enemy blew up that location, no one
                would be able to communicate.
                USA knew they needed an indestructible communications network.

                <strong>General Dwight Eisenhower</strong>, supreme commander in World War II, and the 34th president of USA, played a
                big role in technology research. He saw that the future of war is technology.
                In other words, it will be very technologically advanced stuff that makes USA win economically. Thus,
                Eisenhower decided to invest in research, creating DARPA.

                <strong>DARPA</strong>, founded in 1958, was a government agency created for advanced research projects. Their main goal
                was to solve the circuit-switching problem. Soon, DARPA became a centralized agency that did all of the
                research for universities, big companies and the military. This provided some degree of civilian control
                and oversight through the congress of US.

                <strong>J.C.R Licklider</strong>, was an American psychologist and computer scientist who is considered to be one of the
                notable figures in the development of the internet.
                Licklider created the idea of a universal network. In other words, he invented a way that a message
                could self-check itself that it was correct without sending a complete copy of the message again.
                His work invented a new field called information theory and his mathematics laid the theoretical
                groundwork for what a network would be.

                <h4><u><strong>Packet-Switching</strong></u></h4>
                Luckily, the solution to the circuit switching problem was <strong>packet-switching.</strong> Packet-switching is a new
                approach to data transmission, where a message is divided into several packets that can be routed
                independently to their destination.
                Information flows through packets to find its way to the network. Each packet has an address of where it
                wants to go and follows a path to the address. A node
                would decide where to send each packet. But a node will
                keep a copy of the packets and keep sending them out until they arrive successfully at the next node.
                Circuit switching doesn’t work well because if one wire is cut, there is no way to automatically send a
                signal again, and no way to check if information is correct. With data, you can’t see what’s going
                through the wire, you need analytics to self-correct messages on the network. Licklider proposed this to
                ARPA and they combined his theory with electrical engineers and created the universal network.
